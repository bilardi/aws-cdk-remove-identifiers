Getting started
===============

AWS CDK remove identifiers package is implemented for helping you to test your `AWS CDK <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html>`_ code.

The goal is to compare the previous template saved with the new template synthetized. By `Jest <https://jestjs.io/>`_, you can match by *toMatchObject* method your template synthetized by your **TypeScript** code with a template that you saved.

It is part of the `educational repositories <https://github.com/pandle/materials>`_ to learn how to write stardard code and common uses of the TDD.
